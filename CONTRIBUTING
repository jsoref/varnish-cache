Contributing to Varnish Cache
=============================

Official development tree is here:

    https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache

These days we prefer patches as pull requests directly to that tree.

Bugreports go there too.

Our main project communication is through our developer IRC channel::

	#varnish-hacking on server irc.linpro.no

(That channel is not for user questions, use the #varnish channel for that.)

Mondays at 15:00 EU time we hold our weekly "bugwash" where we go
through new (and old) tickets.  It speeds things up a lot if you
can join the channel and answer questions directly when we go over
the ticket.

GitHub pull requests
--------------------

Pull requests are handled like other tickets.

Trivial pull requests (fix typos, etc) are welcomed, but they may be committed
by a core team member and the author credited in the commit message.
